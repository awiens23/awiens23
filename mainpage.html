		<h3> Undergraduate First Aid Iniative at Queen's </h3>
		<h4> Co-Founder / Chairman </h4>
		<p> After a tragic incident this summer, I realized how fast accidents can happen, and how important first aid training is.
		Upon returning to Queen's, a friend and I started UFAIQ to provide Queen's students with accessible first aid training. We are
		currently working hosting the first clinic on campus. </p>

		<h3> Queen's Relectric Design Team </h3>
                <h4> Interior Subteam - Member </h4>
		<p> The Relectric team is currently working on converting a gas Jeep Wrangler to be
		fully electric. Members of the Interior Subteam worked on various projects,
		including modeling a new dashboard, programming a custom head unit, wiring
		sensors, and reupholstering the seats. </p>

		<h2> Past Projects </h2>
		<h3> APSC 200 Design Project </h3>
		<h4> Part One </h4>
		<p> The first project was a 6 week theoretical exercise based on planning a manned mission to Mars. The main constraint was 
		all fuel would be consumed during transit, so the team had to find a way to generate fuel on planet. The first proposed solution
		was to use carbon dioxide, sunlight and Martian ice to grow cyanobacteria, which would in turn would create O<sub>2</sub> to feed
		E. Coli bacteria that would produce 2,3-Butanediol to use as fuel. The second solution again used Martian ice, which is melted and
		fed into a capillary-drawn electrolyis system to seperate H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. My role in the project was to plan
		the logistics and conduct the economic analysis. This involved extensive research into everything needed to survive on Mars, 
		creating a timeline from launch to return, and creating an intensive budget.  </p>
		<h4> Part Two </h4>
		<p> This project centered around identifying a current inclusivity problem in today's sports industry and solving it. 
		The team chose to redesign an archer's arm guard to be inclusive to any body type or gender. The design portion of the 
		project included 3D modelling a lattice to best absorb shock, and then conducting Finite Element Analysis. For this project,
		my role was to help model and conduct the FEA using SolidWorks, as well as conduct the economic analysis of the project. This 
		involved market research, product design, material sourcing, and pricing the project. </p>
