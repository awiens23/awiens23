		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> I'm a third year student at Queen's University, currently studying Mechanical Engineering, as well as a Certificate in Business. Please check out my resume, linked below. 		</p>
		<p> My Resume: <a href="Addison Wiens Resume 2024.pdf">Addison Wiens</a></p>
		<p> One of my favourite hobbies is working on my cardio. I'm currently working to improve on my swimming abilities, as well as advance my distance running. 
		This May, I had the pleasure of participating in the Million Reasons Run with some friends, which helps raise money for Children's Hospitals all across Canada. 
		The goal was to run as much as possible during the month of May, and I contributed 144km to the team. My next goal is to race in a triathalon, but I'll have 
		to work on my cycling before that happens. </p>

		<p> Another one of my favourite things is baking, which I try to do at least once a week. Shown below are some of my favourite creations.
